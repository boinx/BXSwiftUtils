     Creates a TypedKVO token belonging to the key-value-observation of `keyPath`.
     
     - Parameters:
        - observedObject: The object at the root of the key path.
        - keyPath: The Swift 4 `KeyPath` which must only contain properties and classes that are exposed to Objective-C
                   and marked as `@objc dynamic`.
        - options: The `NSKeyValueObservingOptions` options set, defaulting to `.initial` & `.new`.
        - closure: The closure that will take the following parameters when the observed value changes or one of the
                   `keyPath`'s intermediate objects get deallocated:
        - target: The weakly retained `observedObject` to avoiding the need of capturing it.
        - change: A `Change` struct containing `oldValue` and `newValue`, if availabile.
     
     - throws: `invalidArgumentException` if the keyPath contains properties that are not exposed to Objective-C.
