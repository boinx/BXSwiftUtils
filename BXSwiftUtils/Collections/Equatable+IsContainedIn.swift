    /**
     Checks whether the value is contained in the given collection.
     
     This function is basically syntactic sugar around `collection.contains...` that enhances the readability of that
     call and is much more concise than comparing against every value individually.
     
     Use of this function can be further abbreviated by the `~==` operator.
     
     ## Example
     
         if currentState ~== [.running, .scheduled]
         {
            // do something
         }
     
     - parameter collection: The collection of possible values that should be checked.
     - returns: `true` if the value is contained in the collection, `false` otherwise.
