     Dispatches `block` for async execution or executes it directly if already on the correct queue.
 
     This function may only be called on the main queue. Using any other queue will result in an assertion being
     triggered during debug builds or incorrect operation in release builds.

             This code will run on the main queue.
             It will be ran synchronously if the caller was already on
             the main queue, or scheduled asynchrounsly otherise.
