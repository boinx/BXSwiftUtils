/**
 A read-write lock that allows parallel read operations happening exclusively with serial write opertations.
 The benefit of using an RW Lock is that mutliple read operations from concurrent threads do not block each other.
 
 It is the programmer's responsibility to not modify the protected resource within read blocks!
 
 Both read and write operations may return data or throw exceptions which will be simply passed on to the calling code.

     has threads available, so recusrive calls of undetermined depth still have to be avoided.

     This function is reentrant in the sense that the following will work correctly and *not* deadlock:
     
     ````
     lock.write {
         // (1): Must not change the current queue here
         lock.write {
             // ...
         }
         lock.read {
             // (2): Reading during a write is also ok if the code is running on the correct internal queue
         }
         // ...
     }
     ````
     
     Note: This is only true if the operations in (2) did not change the queue the second `write` is executed on. For
     example the following code would still deadlock, because the call at (2) would fail to recognize that the write lock
     on `lockA` is alredy acquired.
     
     ````
     lockA.write {
     lockB.write {
     lockA.write { } // (3): Deadlock here
     }
     }
     ````
